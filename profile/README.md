This is the public organisation holding the repositories from galimulator's stianloader project (formerly called starloader,
but renamed in order to avoid any confusion with Starmade's modloader).

## Getting started

SLL is the heart of the project, you can get it by either compiling it yourself (which gives you the most flexible experience) from
https://github.com/stianloader/Starloader or by using bleeding-edge builds from either https://stianloader.org/maven/org/stianloader/launcher-micromixin/
or https://stianloader.org/maven/de/geolykt/starloader/launcher-sponge/ (the difference between the two downloads are the variant
of mixins that are bundled, but from an official API standpoint both should have around the same capability).

However, the setup might be a bit complicated so either hop on galimulator's discord for some periodic download bundles in
the #modding channel, or hop on our discord server for some handholding

For further help, visit our discord at: https://discord.gg/CjnPMxsAX6
Alternatively (if discord is not your thing), there is #galimulator-modding @ irc.esper.net; Though beware that the usual IRC rules apply (it might be
best to mention me as otherwise the chances are high that I won't see your message, and it might take quite the while until I respond).
You can always create a discussion on github (this will likely have lower response latencies than IRC, and be on par with discord)

## To those that aren't part of galimulator modding

There isn't really any galimulator modding community besides me, so chances are that whoever you are isn't
interested in modding galimulator. However, that shouldn't distract you from contributing to this project.
Quite a high amount of repositories held under this organisation are meant to be usable in many general-purpose java projects.
